## Introduction
This repository contains a test automation framework using Playwright, Cucumber, and JavaScript. The framework enables behavior-driven development (BDD) for end-to-end testing, ensuring robust and maintainable test suites. It integrates seamlessly with Jenkins for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD). This framework covers UI and API testing both.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before setting up the framework, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (>= 18.x)
- npm (>= 10.x)
- Playwright (Latest)
- Cucumber.js (Latest)
- Jenkins (for CI/CD) (As per your Enterprise Project need)

### Installation
Clone the repository and install the dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Maruf91/Playwright-Cucumber.git
cd <repository-directory>
npm install
```

## Project Structure
Below project structure has been maintained for the implemented framework:

## Writing Tests

### Creating Feature Files
Feature files describe the test scenarios in a human-readable format:
```bash
Feature: Example feature

  Scenario: Example scenario
    Given I navigate to the homepage
    When I click on the login button
    Then I should see the login form
```    
### Step Definitions
Step definitions connect feature file steps to Playwright actions:

```bash
const { Given, When, Then } = require('@cucumber/cucumber');
const { expect } = require('@playwright/test');

Given('I navigate to the homepage', async function () {
    await page.goto('https://example.com');
});

When('I click on the login button', async function () {
    await page.click('#login-button');
});

Then('I should see the login form', async function () {
    expect(await page.isVisible('#login-form')).toBe(true);
});
```
## Running Tests

### Before running the test case setup your .env file
In this .env file you can setup your cucumber tags(Test cases/suites, test environment, testing url etc.)

Use below command to run your test cases(it's customised)
```bash

npm run cucumberTest

```
## Reporting
Cucumber HTML report is integrated for this framework where each step will take snap of the 
application and place it in report along with pass/fail status.
How to run report command to generate HTML report after running all the test cases:
```bash

npm run cucumberReport

```

## Jenkins & JIRA XRAY Integration

### Jenkins Pipeline Configuration
```bash

A jenkins pipeline has been developed from scratch to run this framework in remote system as part of CI/CT.
The pipeline has been already tested and proven. The pipeline can be run on MAC/WINDOWS/UNIX system
, its developed in such a way that it can handlle any type of remote system.
The pipeline is JIRA XRAY integrated, i,e. it can update pass/fail status of the pre created manual 
regression/smoke suites.

To understand the pipeline and to integrate in your project please reach out to Owner of this project

```

## Contributing
This is fully developed by myself from scratch.
This is a portable framework.

## License
There is no need of license to use the framework as it's using all the open source products.
Individual products has their own open source license.
## N.B This is a developing framewrok, in future this framewrok will be more robust and more powerful.
